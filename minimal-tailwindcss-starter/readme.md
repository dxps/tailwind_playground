## A minimal TailwindCSS Starter

This is a minimal starter (a CLI based, not using CDN, of course) for TailwindCSS.

<br/>

## Prereqs

-   Node.js version 18 or later.
-   `npm i` to install the dependencies.

<br/>

## Usage

If you're having also [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) installed, first run `nvm use`. This is to make sure you're using the expected Node.js version.

Use `npm run build` to build the CSS file (saved in `css/style.css`).

Use `npm run watch` to continuously build the CSS file (saved in `css/style.css`) based on detected changes in any HTML file (such as `index.html`) that exists on the project root.

With VSCode's _Live Server_ feature, you can quickly get an automatic page reload in the browser as well.
